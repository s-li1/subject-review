The goals of the subject are to explore more thoroughly the assumptions, implications, and failures of several fundamental standard economic models, to develop alternative, behavioural models based on findings from psychology, and to explore the implications of the new models. The subject develops a better understanding of standard economic theory, a richer appreciation for the way that economists think, and an interesting set of insights about the ways that human psychology affects economic decision-making."

This view is enriched, using models of decision-making based on research in psychology, which allow for beliefs that are not fully rational, as well as for alternative preferences and limits to cognition. Using real data, students will calculate the metrics used to make financial decisions, they will learn how to apply decision-making rules to those metrics, and they will discover the systematic pitfalls and biases that plague decision-making, as well as techniques for overcoming them."

        "description": "This subject seeks to provide an understanding of the strategic development of fundraising and revenue streams for events and not-for-profit organisations. One of the defining features of a not-for-profit organisation is that its core purpose is not necessarily related to its income generation. For events, revenue streams outside of ticket/registration fee-based revenue are integral to their success. The subject examines a variety of potential revenue streams including sponsorship, grants, merchandising, media rights, as well as other sources such as competitions, auctions and donations. The alignment of fundraising strategies with an organisation's mission and values are explored, as are the legal and ethical issues for revenue generation. Within an increasingly competitive environment for not-for-profit organisations and events, maximising revenue streams is a major challenge, and this subject will add to the skills and knowledge set of future event and not-for-profit managers.

Although the focus is on new products, the forces driving the process stem from the need for organisations to remain relevant, effective and competitive in a dynamic environment. While the subject matter is primarily from the field of marketing, the nature of successful product and growth management requires sensitivity to other fields of study such as strategic management, finance, manufacturing, information technology and organisational behaviour in order to effectively guide the process. This subject requires students to explore the various fields of study and examine research as a basis for building a strong, practically oriented capability for new product management.\nIndividual and team projects have been designed into the subject which require students to come to terms with the applied aspects of new product management. Students own work experiences also greatly facilitate class discussion and debate on the topic."

It explores and evaluates the government's ability to identify and achieve more efficient and equitable outcomes. Students extend their knowledge of welfare economics and examine the motivation behind government intervention in the economy. They see why a market economy fails to achieve efficient solutions in the presence of public goods, externalities, natural monopoly and asymmetric information. The subject explains the mechanisms of collective choice, cost\u2013benefit analysis and income redistribution and explores the theory of taxation. Students enhance their ability to distinguish between progressive and regressive taxes, between formal and effective incidence, and between efficient and equal taxes. They also examine how individuals react to income taxes and benefits by modifying their labour supply and consumption behaviour. Finally, the subject presents specific sectors where government intervention is traditionally active, such as health care and education, with emphasis on the Australian economy."

The underlying concept considered in this subject is how an organisation in a changing environment can best manage its human resources in such a way as to provide long-term benefits to the organisation."

To do this, the subject takes the perspective of the executive management, rather than the functional perspective (e.g. accounting, finance, marketing) students have encountered in other subjects. The focus is thus on how actions, decisions and events impact the organisation as a whole. The subject starts by examining how strategy has been thought of over the years and ends by providing a coherent framework for understanding its components and dimensions. The focus then shifts to investigating the reasons why studies show persistent differences in organisational performance and how students can shape their strategy to exploit these forces. To do this, students need to be able to create and implement strategy. The subject looks at how this is done and why this process so often fails. At the end of this subject, student are able to understand, critique, communicate and materially contribute to the development and execution of strategy within organisations."

Firstly, students will be exposed to logically consistent, evidence-based frameworks for building effective strategies and approaches to evaluating them. As many strategies either fail to see the light of day or combust on impact with reality, as a second step, we will focus on strategy execution and implementation. Understanding organisational change, power, politics and culture are crucial to getting this right. Each of these steps will be navigated with a focus on how organisational legitimacy, accountability and ethics shape the process. Upon completing this subject, a student will be equipped with cutting edge tools and frameworks required to formulate strategy in the complex decision-making environment that defines the executive function."

        "description": "In today\u2019s global and connected economy, any company pursuing global growth sees its supply chain and logistics networks as critical to competitive advantage. Advances in information technology, introduction of new products with shorter life cycles, intensified competition in global markets, and the heightened expectations of customers have contributed to the development of new approaches to procurement and supply chain management. While designing an effective global supply network is a challenge, it can be a rewarding one because it can create more valuable products or services for delivery by a firm. This has created incentive for more effective and efficient designs of supply networks. This growing concern has created an incentive for more effective and efficient design of supply networks, thus allowing this subject to focus on imperative design considerations of both strategic and tactical aspects of value networks and logistics network design which all procurement and supply chains managers should know. The strategic intent on the supply side sourcing segments and procurement strategies, and demand side logistic strategies and market behavioral segments, changes the design of supply chains. And at the tactical level, how cost patterns of product delivery; efficient sourcing and procurement; forecasting methods; designing layouts; data aggregation and data mining for quality improvement and network management; and packaging, etc. influence logistic networks, distribution and warehousing decisions. Both of these dimensions provide students with in-depth understanding of how to strategise and position different building blocks to ensure dynamic alignment across a logistics and supply chain network. The concepts and strategies taught provide students with the ability to operationalise practices that can affect cost and service performance in end-to-end supply chains for global competitiveness."

        "description": "Risk and complexity in supply chains are major issues faced by the industry in today's volatile environment. The concept of the resilient enterprise as defined by Yossi Sheffi (MIT, 2005) is a core concept of this subject. Organisational resilience stems from a growing need to manage the uncertainty of complex and interconnected modern societies and economies where managing risks encourages critical businesses to engender a more organic capability to deal with unexpected disruptions. It is in this context that this subject focuses on two strategically important concepts of complexity and risk in global supply chain management. Students are equipped with a wide range of skills to manage risk and complexity in supply chain sources and develop strategies to manage complexity and risk in uncertain conditions. Topics include understanding resilience in supply chains; differentiating and recognising sources of risks in supply chains; the role of procurement strategies and insurance options in risk management; decision-making for risk management; and leadership in mitigating risks in complex supply chains. The risk management skills are used by multiple stakeholders including those who directly manage the intra- and inter-organisational operations, as well as those who plan and design the supply chain; manage customer expectations and deliver service experience to customers as an approach to boost resilience, and help maintain a competitive edge and drive profitability. Ethical implications and social responsibilities arising from risks in supply chains are also discussed."
