UX is defined as a person's perceptions and responses that result from the use of a digital product, system or service. Understanding how to approach UX in design is a major focus in interaction design because the quality of UX can affect people's adoption of a particular designed technology. For many technology design companies, paying attention to how people experience their products is the edge that can potentially set them apart from their competition. However, designing UX effectively is difficult because the term UX is very problematic, meaning very different things to different people, in academic research and in industry.  Firstly, students are provided with some conceptual tools to help them talk about UX productively: to identify, describe, analyse and critique real-life experiences with various types of digital technologies. To put these skills into practice, students are introduced to a range of current and emergent human-computer interactions such as mobile and social computing, pervasive and ubiquitous computing, quantified self, and the 'internet of things' (IoT). Through discussing and exploring particular characteristics, interaction styles, affordances, and the ways these technologies are used in our everyday lives, students develop the skills to be able to understand the types of user experiences that arise from people's interactions with particular technologies, while pursuing specific goals, whether alone or with others, carried out in particular contexts. Through this, they understand how to consider relevant and appropriate user experiences to support when designing for different kinds of human-computer interactions. Students also learn methods, concepts, and techniques used in design activities to support for a specific user experience. This includes user research techniques, sketching, storyboarding, prototyping and evaluation approaches that can support them to design appropriate and engaging user experiences. They hone their skills through responding to a real-world problem, designing a technology solution that not only meets the users' needs effectively but, more importantly, supports desirable and potentially engaging experiences. By building upon students' prior understandings of fundamental interaction design concepts and processes, it is expected that when they successfully complete this subject, they are able to not only design useful and usable technologies, but also technologies that are optimised to support the users' experience."

        "description": "Designing computer games is a challenging task. It is not as simple as just having an idea or jumping straight into coding or creating visual assets without a plan. A high-quality game design must be well structured and documented, carefully crafted for a specific target audience, communicated and negotiated with a team of other designers, scoped to be implementable by a given team of developers within time constraints, and evaluated and iterated on many times until a finely tuned game experience emerges. A professional game designer is an engineer of entertainment. Thus, in this subject, students will be taught the theoretical concepts and practical methodologies needed to ideate, communicate, implement, and improve upon your designs. In this way, students will learn to combine their existing software and game development skills with creativity and iterative design thinking to craft compelling interactions between players and the system of rules that govern them. Students will start by applying these theories and process to the creation of a physical board game prototype before moving on to creating a digital game in a popular game engine. This subject does not teach game development (e.g. coding or art asset creation) but instead requires students to self-learn what is needed to implement their group's shared vision. Students will adopt a kit-bashing approach to rapidly prototype and iterate on their game designs and playtest them with other students on a weekly basis to collect and analyse feedback. By the end of the session, students will have both a board game and digital game that are novel and refined, which can be used in future employment portfolios to highlight interaction design skills in entertainment domains."

As such it is designed to equip students with knowledge and skills to solve process-related problems and innovate processes in a variety of domains (e.g. health, education, transportation, humanitarian aid, disaster management and so on). Students then develop practical skills in modelling, redesigning and ethical innovation of enterprise processes in various organisational settings. Building upon Business Process Management (BPM), the subject extends the process management beyond business and equips the students to apply their knowledge and skills to a variety of problems within and beyond any type of organisation in a variety of domains (eg health, education, transportation, humanitarian aid, disaster management and so on). Students develop a detailed understanding of the concepts, strategies, tools and technologies required for modelling, analysis, design, improvement, integration, performance measurement and governance of enterprise processes (both intra- and inter-enterprise) in any organisational and/or value chain context and relevant industry standards. Students develop practical skills in modelling, redesigning and improving enterprise processes using various BPM software tools/suites. "

        "description": "When designing an interactive product, the designer should know who they are designing for and their needs, wishes and abilities. This is how human-centred design makes people central to the design process. There are many human-centred design methods and several of them are touched on in other interaction design subjects. In this subject we give an overview of the breadth of these methods and focus on two different methods: interviewing and cultural probes. Interviewing is one of the most popular methods in human-centred design. The many reasons include the fact that interviewing provides direct information from interviewees, is relatively easy to do (though difficult to do well) and is inexpensive. The interviewing method is flexible in its use, exists in a large number of variations and can be used at any stage of the design process. Cultural probes, by contrast, is a design method that requires sets of props (probes) which are specifically created or collected to be issued to participants to elicit their response. This method is open and creative, and needs more preparation, but has the potential to generate inspirational responses that can inform design. In this subject students implement both the interviewing method and the cultural probe method, step-by-step through guidance. Students are given a brief to guide their interviewing and cultural probe implementation. Examples are shared of different types of interview and probe methods, and the student can choose to implement the ones that fit their goal best. Students have to recruit their own study participants, at least three to interview and one for the probe study."

It is of particular relevance to students who are questioning how useful architecture and design is in an agile world where accepted best practice is to \u201cfail fast\u201d and iterate quickly rather than follow carefully laid plans. More specifically, this subject introduces the student to two distinct forms of architecture:  Enterprise Architecture, which addresses the strategic question of how IT can best be utilised and aligned to support business needs. The subject focuses on a pragmatic form of enterprise architecture that accepts that organizations constantly evolve and that uncertainty is inescapable. This means that it is generally neither feasible nor desirable to design IT landscapes in exhaustive detail, and yet it would be risky to leave them to evolve at the whim of individual projects. Students learn which aspects of an organization are most useful to model, and develop a toolbox of artefacts to capture and communicate this information. Solution Architecture, which addresses the tactical question of how best to deliver specific IT solutions that best address specific business needs. This subject focuses on how architects and analysts can work effectively with agile development teams, to ensure that business needs and architectural concerns are not lost in the agile software development process that might otherwise focus exclusively on end-users. It helps students recognise when aspects of a system should be defined up-front, and when they are better left to be discovered through the agile process. Students learn how and when to apply proven architectural patterns, how to recognise and avoid common architecture problems, and how to model system architectures using diagrams that are useful and easy to understand.

Complex systems have characteristics that make their behaviour very difficult, if not impossible, to predict. Certainly, traditional analytic approaches are not adequate in the realm of complex systems. Modelling and simulation offer a way to explore such systems. Such models provide a window through which we may study the behaviour of complex systems, and of the impacts our interventions into these systems may have. When we think about just how prevalent complex systems are \u2013 from naturally occurring ecological systems, climate systems through to social, financial, communications and transport systems, we can begin to appreciate the importance and significance of complex system models and simulations. This microcredential introduces learners to the essentials of modelling complex systems. There are many approaches that are popularly used for such modelling. This microcredential shows learners how to determine which approach may be more useful in a given situation. Students learn to look at a particular system and, through studying its characteristics, classify it. This is important when we are trying to model the system."

        "description": "Designing computer games is a challenging task. It is not as simple as just having an idea or jumping straight into coding or creating visual assets without a plan. A high-quality game design must be well structured and documented, carefully crafted for a specific target audience, communicated and negotiated with a team of other designers, scoped to be implementable by a given team of developers within time constraints, and evaluated and iterated on many times until a finely tuned game experience emerges. A professional game designer is an engineer of entertainment. Thus, in this subject, students will be taught the theoretical concepts and practical methodologies needed to ideate, communicate, implement, and improve upon your designs. In this way, students will learn to combine their existing software and game development skills with creativity and iterative design thinking to craft compelling interactions between players and the system of rules that govern them. Students will start by applying these theories and process to the creation of a physical board game prototype before moving on to creating a digital game in a popular game engine. This subject does not teach game development (e.g. coding or art asset creation) but instead requires students to self-learn what is needed to implement their group's shared vision. Students will adopt a kit-bashing approach to rapidly prototype and iterate on their game designs and playtest them with other students on a weekly basis to collect and analyse feedback. By the end of the session, students will have both a board game and digital game that are novel and refined, which can be used in future employment portfolios to highlight interaction design skills in entertainment domains."

Recognising the importance of data visualisation literacy in various disciplines including IS, the subject differs from other more common data visualisation subjects by emphasising (i) learning the whys behind doing data visualisation in addition to the how to dos, (ii) identifying business/organisational cases and their requirements, the stakeholders, and their problem space and decision-making needs, (iii) visual ethics and responsible use of visual data, and (iv) utilising commercial data visualisation software instead of elaborate coding. In short, the subject treats visualisation as a \u201cverb\u201d rather than a \u201cnoun\u201d and aims for visual problem exploration \u201cthrough data\u201d rather than creation of static visual outputs. To this end, the subject is taught in a studio setting with a focus on design thinking exercises and ethical visual analytics. Students develop the necessary skills and the mindset for problem finding and solving through visual data exploration that goes beyond creation of static visual outputs. These skills include identification of different stakeholders and analysis of their decision-making needs and environments, problem formulation, finding and ethical harvesting of relevant data, data quality, data integration, multidimensional modelling, and development of a data exploration prototype using a commercial data visualisation software. Focusing on value creation and decision-making needs of different stakeholders, students also learn how to use data-driven visual storytelling and other contemporary techniques to explore the problem space, inform, influence and inspire different types of stakeholders (including business and IT)."

        "description": "Students use feedback and self-reflection to enhance their knowledge and self-awareness of their roles and behaviors in a professional placement and, thereby, develop the \u2018personally reflective\u2019 graduate attribute. They engage and critically reflect on the professional placement so that they can further their understanding of specific professional organisations. This subject also gives an opportunity for the student to be able to enhance their academic skills, by doing a mini-academic, scholarly literature review on the problem context related to the student's work experience."

        "description": "This subject supports students to observe and reflect on the application of transferable skills required by and applied in the workplace by practising information technology professionals. Students develop their reflective skills through regular journal entries. Students also consider their current level of attainment of the FEIT Graduate Attributes, how they can further develop these attributes and how they can communicate their attainment of these attributes to potential employers. Because each individual student's work experience is unique and IT is a very diverse field, students are required to become active learners and take the initiative and responsibility to seek opportunities to fulfil the objectives of this experience subject. This subject provides tools and techniques to support this learning. This subject can only be undertaken while on a faculty-approved internship. See the FEIT Professional Practice Program Forum on UTSOnline for internship information and requirements."

        "description": "The IT industry is a fast-paced environment in which professionals must continually develop new skills and knowledge to stay current. This is also a requirement of Australian Computer Society membership. This subject assists students to develop their own approach to learning and professional development through the institution of a learning plan tailored to their discipline and workplace context. Students, in consultation with mentors, supervisors and teaching staff, develop a plan to meet the needs of their current workplace position as well as their future professional goals. Students demonstrate their progress by creating resources communicating a topic of their choice in IT. Finally, students reflect on the learning from their plan to develop a deeper understanding of the work they have done and the learning process. This subject can only be undertaken while on a faculty-approved internship. See the FEIT Professional Practice Program Forum on UTSOnline for internship information and requirements."

        "description": "This subject further supports students to observe and reflect on the application of transferable skills required by and applied in the workplace by practising information technology professionals. Students develop their reflective skills through regular journal entries. Students also consider their current level of attainment of the Skills for the Information Age, how they can further develop these skills and how they can communicate their attainment of these skills to potential employers. Because each individual student's work experience is different and IT is very diverse, students are required to become active learners and take the initiative and responsibility to seek opportunities to fulfill the objectives of this subject. As this is the second subject in this area that students complete, it is envisaged that less guidance is required and further extension in their work is encouraged. This subject can only be undertaken while on a faculty-approved internship. See the FEIT Professional Practice Program Forum on UTSOnline for internship information and requirements."

        "description": "This is a project based subject intended to bring together and integrate knowledge and skills gained in the course as a whole, to apply these to an initially unstructured problem, to extend current competencies and to develop competencies that have not been sufficiently emphasised in the student's choice of subjects or practice to date. The project is expected, but not required, to be completed in the workplace while the student is on placement. The project will be planned, carried to completion and documented to a professional standard. The project is expected to provide a bridge to the student's professional future, the opportunity to demonstrate professional competencies and capabilities, to provide scope to demonstrate initiative and creativity, and to take pride in its achievement. Because each student\u2019s work experience is different and IT is very diverse, employers or host organizations are not expected to provide formal training (although some may choose to do so). Students are required to become active learners and to seek opportunities to fulfil this subject\u2019s objectives."
