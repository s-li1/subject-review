Investibility is defined in this subject as designing a prototypical solution that meets an unmet need (is desirable to people), can be delivered to the market (technically feasible) and can be structured in an appropriate business model (viable business). Together these are the three innovation challenges in this subject. Working in teams, students identify customer needs, design prototypical solutions using the latest design thinking methods and design value, delivery and business propositions. Customer validation is used to refine prototypes and business models throughout the subject that emphasises the commercialisation phase. This subject provides a roadmap for product and business design. Students create prototypical products and services and a project design portfolio that can prepare them for success in other project-based work, in graduate employment, or in startup ventures."

        "description": "Autonomous control systems play an essential role in modern society. Classical linear control approaches can be used to govern (linear) systems where normally one variable needs to be controlled (e.g., room temperature in an air-conditioning system, water level in a tank, etc.). However, there are many modern complex process and applications that require control systems to autonomously govern several variables at the same time, e.g., power systems, industrial process, aircraft, electric vehicles, etc. Moreover, some systems can even present nonlinear dynamics, which further complicate the control process design. For this reason, more sophisticated control techniques (compared to classical methods learned in previous subjects) need to be designed and implemented to govern more complex systems. This studio subject focuses on aspects of advanced control engineering design for multivariable systems. The overall aim of this studio is to provide a rich and attractive practice-based learning environment for electrical engineering students to deeply learn and become professionally competent in advanced control engineering. Students will work from concept stage to realisation of product, thus, striking a balance between theory and practice. To realise these aims, this studio focuses on the methods of reflective design practice, teamwork, mentoring, and deep learning techniques, including immersion in difficult problems. The subject allows students to move towards senior roles in teams, expects students to become accomplished in reflection, and demonstrate application of modern and advanced control engineering skills, with an accent on design, simulation and practical validation."

        "description": "A graduate project is a significant body of engineering work that is conducted in a professional manner and is documented in a comprehensive report. It provides an opportunity for students to demonstrate their advanced skills and knowledge that have been gained as part of their coursework and apply these to a real-world engineering problem. The depth and extent of the project can vary with credit point requirements. The project may involve the development of a new technology, product and/or process, or the application of existing technologies, products and methods in a new way, to solve a problem. In certain cases it may be appropriate to undertake a critical review of a method, ideas, a technology or combinations of these. In all cases it is vital that the project can demonstrate a 'value-added' component that the student has originated. The planning, implementation and documentation of the project are supervised by a member of academic staff from the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology. The scope of the work, the deliverables for assessment and the assessment criteria are negotiated between the student and the academic supervisor and documented in a learning contract that is signed by the student and supervisor(s) (and approved by the director of postgraduate coursework programs). Industry-based projects are highly encouraged and an additional industrial supervisor may be involved. The responsibility of finding a suitable project topic and an academic supervisor rests with the student."

It also aims to develop their skills in analysing simple structures such as statically determinate beams and trusses, subjected to various loading and support conditions. On completion of this subject, students should be able to apply static equilibrium conditions as tools to analyse simple structures, and have developed an appreciation of design in civil engineering. The principles developed in this subject form the basis of structural analysis and design. This subject introduces students to the fundamental aspects that are a basis for subsequent fields of dynamics in civil engineering such as fluid mechanics, hydraulics and road design."

The success of such a goal is often measured by achieving it on time, what it cost to produce and whether its specifications are met. These goals can also be prerequisites to other larger corporate goals which may also have complex and integral interdependencies together with strict time frames and costs. For engineers to be successful in delivering their parts of projects, an appropriate solution is required (ie agreed quality) as well as delivery (ie on time) to an agreed price (ie to budget). This subject helps students to achieve this. The subject adopts a holistic view of project management, considering issues throughout a project life cycle. It considers the project responsibilities of engineering managers and organisations, from the definition phase of a project to its conclusion. The perspective of stakeholders, particularly the project manager, are considered. The emphasis is interdisciplinary and relevant to all fields of engineering practice. Topics include: modern project management practices; project delivery; definition, timing, costing and planning; managing risk and scheduling resources; teams and inter-organisational relationships; progress and performance; and project measurement and evaluation. This compulsory core engineering subject involves relevant, practice-oriented assessment tasks."

The types of capstone projects that students can undertake include research and development, investigation, experimentation, design, building and manufacturing. Students in this subject develop skills in research design, project management and critical communication. This subject, Engineering Research Preparation, emphasises the development of the theoretical framework and the associated project plan for a student's capstone project. The subject is followed by the implementation phase in 41030. Both subjects aim to strengthen students' knowledge application, and research and communication competencies to the graduate level for engineering practice as per Engineers Australia Stage 1 competencies and faculty graduate attributes. Both subjects also align with Australian Qualifications Framework criteria of graduation concerning knowledge, skills development and application to the bachelor's (level 7) and honours (level 8) degrees."

This helps students to effectively interact and collaborate with legal practitioners in their future work. Students are exposed to the following topics.   Environmental law: the operation of the Environment Protection Authority of NSW, key environmental legislation (such as Protection of the Environment Operations Act, Clean Waters Act, Waste Minimisation Act, Clean Air Act, Noise Control Act, Biodiversity Conservation Act), miscellaneous environmental legislation addressing pollution issues (Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal Act, Sydney Water Corporatisation Act), and selected court decisions relating to pollution and land use issues (Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997).   Environmental planning: evolution of human settlement, NSW environmental planning legislation, urban planning and sustainability, planning the neighbourhood, development control processes and development control case studies, environmental studies, environmental impact assessment in NSW, project control and the environment.   During tutorials, students discuss environmental law and planning issues using case studies. Students present a discussion paper on an environmental issue of an engineering nature, which assists in developing communication skills. Examples are drawn from classic law cases around the world, examples from high profile cases in Australia, and major planning exercises in NSW."

It is intended to provide students with a comprehensive overview of elementary mechanics and lay the basis for further work in this area in later subjects. In particular, material discussed in this subject is taken further in Machine Dynamics and Mechanics of Solids subjects in subsequent stages. Newtonian mechanics depends on the development of a series of increasingly complex models based on Newton\u2019s Laws of Motion. The purpose of this modelling concept is to set up an orderly development that is conducive to mathematical analysis. The methodology relies on diagrammatically isolating a physical entity (or body) from all constraints or contacts with other bodies and replacing these contacts with external forces. This relies on discriminating between what are defined as internal and external forces. The mechanically isolated body is referred to as a free body diagram. It requires a graphical, diagrammatic or visual approach to problem analysis, unlike other analytical systems, which rely on more sophisticated mathematical analysis. The topics discussed in this subject include equilibrium in 2D plane and 3D space, force vectors, force system resultants, analysis of pin-connected trusses, characteristics of dry friction, equilibrium of rigid bodies subjected to frictional force, shear force and bending moment diagrams, kinematics and kinetics of a particle, rectilinear kinemtatics, curvilinear motion, force and acceleration, work and energy, impulse and momentum, and the relationships between them. These comprise the basis of a comprehensive course in Newtonian mechanics."

        "description": "Risk management is an essential activity that needs to be undertaken in all engineering and complex systems. It is a key part of an organisation\u2019s safety management system, that provides stakeholders with the process, tools and techniques, to ensure risks are managed to acceptable levels through the projects\u2019 and systems\u2019 lifecycle. This subject provides students with a comprehensive understanding of the risk management process and its application to engineering systems. Students learn to apply risk assessment techniques to examples and case-studies set in the engineering context. The knowledge and tools learned can also be applied outside the engineering systems, to support risk management relating to workplace health, safety and environment, security, and business."

An outline of the discipline and its relationships with other engineering and non-engineering disciplines is provided with particular emphasis on achieving sustainable design and planning outcomes. The subject comprises two strands, transport planning and traffic engineering. The transport planning strand covers the analysis, design and evaluation of transport systems, primarily focusing on public transport provision. In the second strand, students learn about the '4-step transport modelling' approach to determine travel demands at a regional level, a key component of infrastructure feasibility assessments and design to ensure satisfactory operations. Students are also introduced to the fundamentals of traffic flow theory to be equipped with the tools necessary to assess capacity and appraise transport infrastructure. Furthermore, applications of this theory are introduced to students through practical case studies such as the preparation of local area traffic management schemes."

Students develop an understanding of the representation of an industrial robot\u2019s manipulator pose, kinematics and control. Students are given the opportunity to learn about the variety of robot manipulation tasks that are, or could potentially be performed by robots. In teams, students build their own simulated industrial robot. This includes the opportunity to model the robot arm then write control and planning software so that it can perform motion tasks. This subject integrates safety into the design and working procedure, and encourages students to be aware of safety engineering to lower risk and prevent robot-related accidents from occurring. This subject also investigates ethical questions related to the inevitable increase of robots into industry and our daily lives. Discussions are encouraged around the implications these changes have on society, and specifically a human workforce that may no longer be required due to no fault of their own."

Its purpose is to provide an environment in which students can gain and simultaneously translate knowledge into a robotics system. Studios are product-based subjects, largely conducted in the studio, in collaboration with other students, academic staff and industry mentors. Students do a combination of individual self-directed study and project work. This is the first studio in the fundamentals stage of the Robotics Engineering major. The major has three studios situated in the following stages: fundamentals; applications; and professional. The stages of the projects are the means by which students learn how to apply their knowledge to what they can achieve. The stages follow the classic engineering paradigm of assess, design and implement. The objective of this studio is to introduce students to the multidisciplinary field of robotics engineering in both theory and practice. It aims to familiarise students with the robotics topics of mathematics, hardware and software, control and planning, sensing and perception motivated by real-world applications. Individual tasks in this studio are guided by a learning contract established at the beginning of the session. What differentiates the applications studio from the fundamentals studio is the expectation of the level of proficiency of students. Once students have completed the fundamentals and applications studios and a range of coursework subjects, it is expected that they have the skills and knowledge to allow them to undertake the development of more challenging products in the final studio."

        "description": "All engineers who wish to practise as civil engineers in Australia must have knowledge of structural behaviour and design, including design to the relevant Australian Standards. However, practitioners in some of the fields in the broad range of civil engineering do not undertake detailed structural design or are involved in the construction of structures. These civil engineers do not require the depth involved in the detail of structural design (assessment of loads, structural analysis, structural behaviour of different structural materials and the design requirements for different structural materials, in accordance with the relevant Australian Standards). This subject introduces students in certain streams of the civil engineering offerings \u2013 civil and environmental, civil/water \u2013 to the fundamentals of structural behaviour and design of reinforced concrete, structural steel and timber elements. This builds on the knowledge and competence already achieved on the structural analysis of statically determinate structures, internal actions induced by applied loads (axial force, shear force and bending moment) and the response of elements to these internal actions, such as strain and stress distributions across cross-sections. The detail and depth of this subject does not allow the students to attain a sufficient competence to undertake the structural analysis and basic design of anything more complex than simple structural components. The students should achieve sufficient understanding of structural behaviour and design to be able to recognise the basic structural implications that are reflected in the design and construction of structures that they may encounter in their careers as civil engineers in their particular field away from structural engineering. The topics to be covered include Limit State Design philosophy, loads (G, Q, W) and load tributary areas, material design properties of reinforced concrete, structural steel and timber, method of moment distribution for structural analysis for continuous beams, behaviour and design of flexural members for strength (moment and shear) and serviceability (deflection) in reinforced concrete, steel and timber, of tensile members in steel and timber and of columns and beam-columns in reinforced concrete, steel and timber."
