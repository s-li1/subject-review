Students will have the opportunity to both develop sound knowledge and skills to pursue a networking specialisation or to develop a clear model of how networks can impact network-based applications. Students learn the role of routing protocols and how to compare them; how to design construct and implement small to medium-sized intranets; and how to perform basic management and security tasks. The role of TCP/IP, ICMP and other protocols in IP networks are evaluated. Students also learn how CISCO routers and switches are used for the practical work."

Students work collaboratively throughout the session. From week 2 students form groups of three and all lab work is a shared experience. All additional activities, such as researching concepts, exploring networking challenges and building the required networks, are achieved by students working cooperatively. Groups are also encouraged to share their findings with other groups, and while most assessments are individual, this shared knowledge contributes positively to the whole learning experience."

It also introduces mobile threats ranging The subject also covers the security of enterprise networks, while BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) model is being widely adopted in corporate and small/medium size enterprise networks. This poses significant additional and new threats to network security administrators. The subject covers how Shadow IT solutions might not be relevant and how administrators should adapt to circumvent insider attacks enabled by BYOD. The subject takes practice-based learning allowing students to perform penetrations tests to some locally set private networks. It also uncovers some limitations of one the most popular tools to trace back information leakage in mobile apps by giving the students the possibility to demonstrate their own covert channel techniques. Finally, the students are able to adapt a regular network firewalling policy to mobile environment and observe the possible threats and circumvention techniques."

        "description": "This subject exposes students to the latest developments in networking, with a particular focus on the Internet and its measurement, using the research literature as a vehicle. Rather than learning the building blocks of networking in isolation as one would in a traditional networking course, students learn through working to understand, reproduce, and even extend, existing research work, assembling whatever knowledge and skills are needed along the way. Students work directly with research papers, and associated Internet-derived data sets, in diverse ways following a master-apprentice style model of training in face-to-face tutorial and laboratory sessions. Tutorial content combines mathematical and practical tool-kit building. Assessment covers both individual and team work and takes the form of reports, an oral exam, write-ups of experimental findings in the laboratory, including code, and an exam style online Quiz. This is a challenging course that makes extensive use of Matlab for data analysis, as well as CLI tools in Unix. Students should either have a strong grasp of Matlab, or have a strong programming background, enabling them to pick it up quickly. Internet measurement was one of the founding areas of `Big Data', and many of its practices have spread to other areas, and have strongly influenced the rise of `Data Science\u2019. In this course you'll be learning about an Internet flavoured Data Science."

        "description": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a distributed system, in which various autonomous devices, sometimes called motes, collect environmental data (such as location, speed, temperature, humidity and sound level) or, more recently, medical data (such as heart rate, blood oxygen level and pulse rate) and possibly execute controls via actuator devices. The data is collected across the network, aggregated and fed into business applications. Sensor and actuator networks, telemetry, data processing, distributed data bases, machine vision, AI and analytics, software frameworks are enablers for various applications, including environmental monitoring and control, agricultural monitoring and control, medical monitoring, habitat monitoring and military surveillance. In this subject, students learn the theory, the concepts and the practice of IoT-related paradigms. By designing and developing a small to medium-complexity, IoT-based application, students acquire new skills, as well as, learn the benefits of the IoT technology.

The rate of progress in network technologies has been recognised as slow to keep up with the emerging data demands. Both industry and academia have been working on new solutions for networking technologies, which can provide long terms scalability and extensibility. Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a new framework, which is believed to be the answer to the above need. SDN has already made an impact in data centres and enterprise networks and it is seen as a key technology to improve performance and extensibility both at core and access side of networking technologies. Consequently, there is a significant demand from the industry for network engineers with SDN skills. This subject introduces students to SDN and programming SDN applications. Students learn the major concepts in SDN, Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) and learn to develop applications over leading SDN controller through hands-on labs and exercises."
